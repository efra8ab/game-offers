Project Proposal: Steam Game Deals + Library Helper

Overview
A simple web app that helps users find current game deals and track a personal wishlist/library. The problem: it is hard to compare prices quickly across sales and remember which games you want. Motivation: build a fast, practical tool that combines official Steam info with deal pricing in one place.

Target Audience
- PC gamers who shop for Steam games and want quick deal comparisons.
- Students and budget-conscious buyers who want to track price drops.
- Casual users who want a lightweight wishlist without using full store clients.

Major Functions (at least 8)
1) Search Steam games by name and show matching results.
2) View a game detail page with summary, price, and Steam store link.
3) Show current deal price vs. regular price for a game (CheapShark data).
4) Display historical lowest price and deal store name when available.
5) Add/remove games to a local wishlist (localStorage).
6) Show a “My Library/Owned” list (manual add/remove).
7) Filter/sort results by price, discount percent, or popularity.
8) Deal alerts section showing top discounts (global deals list).
9) Quick compare view for a selected set of games.
10) Error/empty states with friendly messages and retry actions.
